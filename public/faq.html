                    To charge an automotive battery, refer to your owner’s manual and your battery charger manual for instructions. Read and follow all safety and handling instructions that came with your charger and battery. Battery chargers will charge a battery based on its condition and at a rate appropriate for its state of charge. Charging voltages run from 13.8 volts to a maximum of 15.5 volts for most applications. Finally, remember that batteries contain sulfuric acid that can cause severe burns, and hydrogen-oxygen gases that can be explosive. Charge in a well-ventilated area. Be sure to follow all safety and handling.

                    Check your battery every now and then to make sure the battery terminal connections are clean, snug and protected from the elements. Signs of corrosion or leaks could mean that the battery is no longer operating optimally.
                    Secure the hold-down bar. This ensures that your battery is snugly seated and will help minimize vibration which can be detrimental to certain types of batteries.
                    Routinely test your battery to make sure it is correctly charged. This allows you to recharge your battery, if needed, to maintain its peak performance. It’s important for your battery’s health to get it tested at least once a year to keep it at its optimal performance level.

                    If storing your vehicle or battery for an extended period of time, aim to keep the battery charged at full capacity throughout the storage period. You can do this by using a battery maintainer – a device that will monitor your battery and keep it at full capacity during storage. If it is not possible to use a maintenance charger, you should fully charge the battery prior to storage and then disconnect it from the vehicle to prevent small electrical drains (such as in-car clocks, security systems and so on) from draining it. Check the battery voltage periodically and recharge it if it falls below 12.6 volts.

                    Under normal conditions the battery should not require adding water during its life. Certain circumstances, however, such as a charging system failure or extreme high temperatures for an extended length of time, can cause the electrolyte level to drop. Should these occur, take the battery to a mechanic or an auto service professional to determine if it needs water.
                    Note: There is no free electrolyte in a VRLA (Valve Regulated Lead-Acid) battery. No effort should be made to test or adjust its electrolyte level.

                    Lead-acid batteries contain hydrogen-oxygen gases that can be explosive, and sulfuric acid that can cause severe burns. To help avoid danger and injury, observe these precautions when handling or working with a lead-acid battery:
                    <ul class="text-base leading-6 text-gray-500">
                      <li>Never lean over the battery while boosting, testing or charging.</li>
                      <li>Do not charge or use booster cables or adjust post connections without proper instructions and training.</li>
                      <li>Exercise caution when working with metallic tools or conductors to prevent short circuits and sparks.</li>
                      <li>Should you have direct contact with the battery fluids, flush the area with water and call a physician immediately.</li>
                      <li>Keep out of the reach of children.</li>
